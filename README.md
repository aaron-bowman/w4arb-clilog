# w4arb-clilog
Command line tool for logging. I made this for SST to start with, just for myself. It's not fancy, just a simple shell script for easy modification and portability. It spits out text for Fast Log Entry to generate ADIF files. This is just so I can have one terminal up during a contest and log all my contacts without any distraction. Feel free to copy and edit as desired.

Features:
- Search and Pounce: Asks for Frequency every QSO
- Run: Only asks for Frequency once
- Call Lookup: When you enter a call, it performs a lookup in HamDB and prints the results in JSON. It's readable enough for me.
