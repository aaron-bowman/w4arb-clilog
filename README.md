# w4arb-clilog
Command line tool for logging. Simple shell script for easy modification and portability. It spits out text for Fast Log Entry to generate ADIF files. This is just so I can have one terminal up during a contest and log all my contacts without any distraction. Feel free to copy and edit as desired.
